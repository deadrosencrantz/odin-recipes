<h2>Description</h2>
<div class = box><p>Ah, the humble raspberry - god amongst fruit, jewel amongst 
    treasures. Fruit is generally difficult for me to eat, but 
    raspberries are perfect. They also pair incredibly well with 
    chocolate when you are in need of a tasty treat.</p>
<p>I suppose you could make this with other small fruits if 
    you want. I've done it once with cherries (which I don't 
    even like - long story) and I don't see why it wouldn't work 
    with something else. But if you want my advice - and, implicitly, 
    you do, since you're reading <em>my</em> website - don't fix 
    what isn't broken.
