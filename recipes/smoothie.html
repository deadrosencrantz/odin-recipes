<h2>Description</h2>
<div class = box><p>Oh, raspberry smoothie, simplest of delights. This thing has 
    always been there for me, bringing just the tiniest little 
    hint of light to the darkest days.</p>
<p>A lot of smoothies are inedible to me because of their ingredients. 
    I am strongly averse to bananas, and therefore, I basically cannot 
    buy premade smoothies. My raspberry smoothie recipe is simple and elegant, 
    using only four ingredients, and it's unbelievably refreshing. I love this thing, 
    and I hope you will too!
