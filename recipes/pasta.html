<h2>Description</h2>
<p>On balance, pasta is my favourite food. When I was a child, 
    I would eat "pasta and hot dipping sauce" any chance I could. 
    ("Hot dipping sauce" was my toddlerese name for passata.) Over 
    time, this evolved to the point that I would add grated cheddar 
    cheese. I will still eat pasta with passata and cheddar cheese 
    happily, but it's not always the right call.
</p>
<p>Sometimes I need nothing more than to put as many vegetables 
    as possible into my body, and this recipe does the trick just 
    excellently. It is descended from a caponata pasta recipe I read 
    online once, but modified to my own interests. I call it "modded capsta" 
    in the note on my phone that reminds me how to make it. By the way, 
    it pairs perfectly with a garlic baguette.
</p>
<p> Serves between 3 and 6, depending on how hungry everybody's feeling.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>~4tbsp olive oil</li>

<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
<li>Boil a kettle to cook the pasta.</li>
<li>Chop the vegetables to your preferred size.</li> 
<li>Put the olive oil in a pan and fry the onions and garlic over a low heat. 
    You can add a little bit of brown sugar to make them start 
    caramelising if you want. Let them cook for at least eight minutes 
    but the longer the better.</li>  
<li>Add the other chopped vegetables to the pan and cook until they are soft 
    enough.</li>

    leave to simmer.</li>
<li>Pour your hot water into a pan and add the pasta. Cook to desired texture.</li>
<li>Once cooked, drain the pasta and add it to the pan with the rest.</li>
<li>Plate up, garnishing with fresh basil leaves and parmesan.</li>
