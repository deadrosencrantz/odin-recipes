# odin-recipes
This is my first project for The Odin Project, where I will display my knowledge of HTML, including use of boilerplate, lists, and images.

All pictures were taken by myself. Okay, admittedly, the only picture I have for the brownies is of the one time I made them with cherries instead. Forgive the discrepancy. The pictures are also all quite unappetising - I'll try to get better ones next time I make them.
