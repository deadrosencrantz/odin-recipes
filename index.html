<h1>Odin Recipes</h1> 
<div class = "box">
<p>I was diagnosed with autism as a young teenager, 
    and, of the <strong>many</strong> things that explained, 
    possibly one of the most basic was my taste in food. 
    There are a lot of things I don't eat, and only really
    a few foods I really like. Unfortunately, existing as 
    a human person means I needed to figure out some kind of 
    way to get the required nutrients to avoid contracting scurvy. 
</p>
<p>Here I've collected some of my favourite recipes. They are all 
    probably descended from recipes I found online and then modified 
    to my taste. One should note that I do not use scales for personal accessibility reasons. You'll only see gram measurements 
    when it is equivalent to the full amount (or half of the full amount) that one 
    would get in an average container in the shop when buying the 
    ingredient. Otherwise, I use UK cups and spoons.
